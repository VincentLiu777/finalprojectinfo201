# finalprojectinfo201
final project for Info 201 


We intend to work with a global dataset dealing with the COVID-19. The dataset 
explicitly contains cumulative data and daily data for vaccine numbers, 
confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, newly increased cases, etc.
This vaccination dataset uses the most recent official numbers from governments 
and health ministries worldwide. All data comes from Global Change Data Lab, on 
their website, it offers detailed information on editors and data collectors.

-------------------------------------------

Questions that our project will answer: 

1. How does the number of people vaccinated influence the trend of increasing confirmed cases of COVID-19?

2. Has the death rate of COVID-19 changed since 2020?

3. How does climate (location of the country) influence on spreading and mortality rate of COVID-19.


-------------------------------------------

For our group’s project, the intended audience could be simply anyone who cares 
and willing to pay attention to the pandemic data. The audience can have a better 
understanding of the pandemic and its influence to various factors after reading 
our group’s report. We are planning to compute graphs based on seasonal influence, vaccination influence. 
Our group’s data will be in a .csv format, and mostly the libraries that we 
choose to use are mainly dplyr, and ggplot2 for computing graphs. Currently, 
we don’t have any immediate challenges anticipated for this project. 
Since our group only have two teammates, we decided to chat individually instead of creating discord channel.
